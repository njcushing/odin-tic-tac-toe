# odin-tic-tac-toe
A Tic Tac Toe game made as part of The Odin Project's 'JavaScript' course.

- The game can be played in either the browser or using the console.
- The game cannot be played unless two players have entered their names or Player 2 is set to one of the two available AI modes.
- The first AI mode is RANDOM; it will select a random cell and choose it.
- The second AI mode is PERFECT; it is an unbeatable AI.
- The game board can also be resized to anything between 3x3 and 9x9 inclusive (although playing Tic Tac Toe on a larger board size seems to have diminishing returns), and the board will be the same quantity of cells on both axes (square).
- A reset button allows the player to reset the state of the board whenever they wish.
